                        </p>

                        <h4>1. Digital Marketing Services (Performance Marketing, SEO, Social Media Management)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cancellation requests must be made at least <strong>10 business days</strong> prior to the next billing cycle.</li>
                            <li>Ongoing paid advertising campaigns will run until the end of the current cycle, without any pro-rata refunds for unused portions.</li>
                            <li>Early termination of long-term service agreements may incur a cancellation fee equivalent to one monthâ€™s service.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Web Design & Development Services</h4>

                            <li>Cancellations can be made at any project stage, but completed work will be billed as per the project milestones.</li>
                            <li>If the cancellation occurs after the design phase but before development begins, a <strong>50%</strong> cancellation fee will be applied.</li>
                            <li>Cancellations after development starts will incur a fee based on completed milestones, plus a <strong>25%</strong> termination fee.</li>
